Hi, my name is Silvana Bates, I am an artist living in Ireland, working we left mostly with Polymer clay. I'm inspired by nature, the beaches, my overgrown garden, with all its flowers and insects. All my work is unique, and entirely handmade. I also work on commissions. My work has been featured on Polymerclaydaily, on Foltbolt, in Making Jewelery, and in From Polymer to Art.
